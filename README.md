## Rules of Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-tac-toe is a strategy game for two players, represented by "X" and "O", who take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to complete a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with your own marks before the opponent. If all spaces are filled and neither player manages to form a line, the game ends in a draw.
